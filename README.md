Hello!

My name is <a href="https://anantamoharana.github.io/" target="_blank">Ananta Moharana</a>. I am a senior at Rutgers University (graduating May 2022), majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.

Most recently, in Summer 2021, I interned at Pfizer as a Data Management and Monitoring Intern, under the Global Biometrics and Data Management department. Specifically, I worked with the database build and programming team!

Besides that, in Summer 2020 I was a Software Engineering Intern at Finacle Soft Inc., a finanacial technology start up, on their flagship product Swift CDS, a credit trading an risk analytics tool.

I have also worked at Rutgers University as a Computer Science and Mathematics tutor and I am currently employed as a resident assistant(RA) by the Rutgers Department of Residence Life.

Outside of school and work I like to stay active. I particularly enjoy powerlifting and bike riding!

I'm interested in software engineering, data engineering, product management, AI/ML, mobile development, and data science!
